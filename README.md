<h1>Managing Access Controls</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
This project identified issues related to authorization and authentication. On 10/03/23, the user, a Legal/Administrator, accessed the payroll systems from IP address 152.207.255.255. Despite his contract ending in 2019, Robert Taylor Jr's admin account was still active and used. The key issues identified include the need for user accounts to expire after 30 days, limited access for contractors, and the implementation of multi-factor authentication (MFA). These recommendations aim to enhance security by ensuring timely account deactivation, restricting access based on user roles, and adding an extra layer of verification to prevent unauthorized access.
